# rrm - Ruby Repository Manager

Trying to make the repetitive task of updating Ruby (and gem dependencies) for multiple projects a bit less painful.

## What does it do?

Give it some URL's to git repositories, and rrm will:
* Clone each repository
* Give you options (unless you chose already) to update to the latest patch, minor or major version of Ruby by updating
  * Gemfile
  * .gitlab-ci.yml
  * .travis.yml
  * .rubocop.yml
  * Dockerfile
* Run bundler inside Docker (with the new Ruby version) to upgrade Gemfile.lock

## Running it

### Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

Tested on macOS Mojave with Ruby 2.6.2 and Docker 18.09.2.

### Usage
