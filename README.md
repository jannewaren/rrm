# rrm - Ruby Repository Manager

Trying to make the repetitive task of updating Ruby (and gem dependencies) for multiple projects a bit less painful.

## What does it do?

Give it some URL's to git repositories, and rrm will:
* Clone each repository
* Update to the latest patch, minor or major version of Ruby by updating
  * Dockerfile
  * Gemfile
  * Gemfile.lock (by running bundle via Docker)
  * .gitlab-ci.yml
  * .rubocop.yml
  * .travis.yml
* Updates gems to latest versions if you choose to
* Push changes in a new branch to remote

Staying up to date with new Ruby versions on tens of projects should be easier than ever!

## Running it

### Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

Tested on macOS Mojave with Ruby 2.6.2 and Docker 18.09.2.

### Usage

Install:
```
gem install rrm
```

Update all projects to the latest available patch version:
```
rrm --urls git@github.com:jannewaren/rrm-demo-app-ancient.git,git@github.com:jannewaren/rrm-demo-app-old.git,git@github.com:jannewaren/rrm-demo-app-new.git --patch-latest
```

Update all projects to the latest available minor version, with gems updated as well:
```
rrm --urls git@github.com:jannewaren/rrm-demo-app-ancient.git,git@github.com:jannewaren/rrm-demo-app-old.git,git@github.com:jannewaren/rrm-demo-app-new.git --patch-latest --update-gems
```

Run `rrm --help` to see all available options.

## TODO

* Interactive mode with some fancy ncurses dialogs etc
* Only update gems in selected groups (to easily update development dependencies more often for example)
* Ways to limit or increase output (--quiet mode and --verbose mode)
* Make proper documentation and refactor all the classes so it could be used as a gem/library inside other projects. For example a Slack bot to update things?
* Is it okay to just pollute the users /tmp/ files like this?
